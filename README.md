## Project Description:

"Brain Games" is a project consisting of 5 console games designed to train your brain. Each game asks 3 questions that you need to answer correctly. If you answer all the questions, you are considered to have completed the game. In case of an incorrect answer, the game will end and you will be offered to try again.

## Installation:
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm link
```

##  To launch games, enter the following commands into the console:
launch the game "Calculator"
```sh
brain-calc
```
launch the game "Progression"
```sh
brain-progression
```
launch the game "Number is even"
```sh
brain-even
```
launch the game "Greatest Common Divisor"
```sh
brain-gcd
```
launch the game "Prime number"
```sh
brain-prime
```

## Demonstration work of the game:
